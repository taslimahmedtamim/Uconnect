## Vision & Summary

- Project Name: UConnect
- Vision: An AI-driven university ecosystem connecting students, teachers, and industry — automating team formation, learning, portfolio building, resume generation, and job/internship discovery.
- Who it serves: Students, faculty/mentors, recruiters/companies.
- Outcomes:
  - Faster, fairer team formation and mentorship.
  - Verified portfolios and certificates as credible hiring signals.
  - Personalized career paths and job matches that reflect true skills.

---

## Development Plan (Web First → Mobile Next)

We will prioritize a web-based release first, then build the mobile app.

- Web first:
  - Focus on core flows: auth, profiles, project/team formation, portfolio, resume generation, opportunity discovery.
  - Ship quickly to validate with students/faculty; iterate based on feedback.
- Mobile next:
  - Build a dedicated mobile app after the web release stabilizes.
  - Target tech: React Native to maximize reuse with the React web stack.
  - Mobile priorities: notifications, quick apply, chat, task updates, mentor sessions.

---

## SDLC & Process (Agile)

- Framework: Agile (Scrum/Kanban hybrid depending on team size and cadence).
- Cadence:
  - Iterative delivery in short cycles.
  - Lightweight planning, continuous refinement, and frequent releases.
- Ceremonies:
  - Planning and backlog refinement
  - Daily standups
  - Review/demo
  - Retrospective with actionable improvements
- Backlog & Prioritization:
  - Value-first prioritization; capture user feedback from web release to inform subsequent iterations and mobile scope.
- Definition of Done:
  - Coded, reviewed, tested, documented (user-facing notes where needed), and deployed.
- Branching & CI/CD:
  - Trunk-based or short-lived feature branches.
  - GitHub Actions for tests/lint/build; preview deployments for frontend; automatic checks before merge.

---

## Mobile App Plan

- Tech: React Native (Expo or bare) to reuse business logic and UI patterns from the web where sensible.
- API: Same REST/GraphQL endpoints; shared types via OpenAPI/Swagger or codegen to reduce drift.
- Auth: OAuth with deep links (App/Universal Links), secure token storage.
- Features (initial):
  - Push notifications for deadlines, chat mentions, mentor feedback.
  - Quick actions: apply to jobs, update task status, check-in for sessions.
  - Lightweight profile edits and resume export links.
- Offline-first (select screens): local cache with background sync for tasks/messages.
- Release: Closed beta after the web release stabilizes; iterate via OTA updates (Expo/CodePush).

---

## Data Model & Concepts

Core entities:
- User (student, teacher, recruiter)
- Profile (skills, GPA, achievements, endorsements)
- Project (repo link, description, outcomes)
- Team (members, roles, approvals)
- Opportunity (job, internship)
- MentorMatch (sessions, feedback)
- U-Score (reputation & performance metrics)
- Roadmap (career path, milestones, resources)

Illustrative ER (simplified)
```mermaid
erDiagram
  USER ||--o{ PROFILE : has
  USER ||--o{ TEAM_MEMBER : participates
  TEAM ||--o{ TEAM_MEMBER : includes
  USER ||--o{ PROJECT : owns
  PROJECT ||--o{ TASK : contains
  PROJECT ||--o{ FEEDBACK : receives
  USER ||--o{ FEEDBACK : gives
  USER ||--o{ OPPORTUNITY_APPLICATION : applies
  OPPORTUNITY ||--o{ OPPORTUNITY_APPLICATION : tracks
  USER ||--o{ CERTIFICATE : earns
  USER ||--o{ ROADMAP : follows
  ROADMAP ||--o{ MILESTONE : contains
```

U-Score considerations:
- Inputs: project outcomes, peer reviews, mentor feedback, code contributions, on-time delivery.
- Guardrails: explainability, bias checks, manual overrides for faculty.

---
