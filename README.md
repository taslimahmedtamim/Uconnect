## Data Model & Concepts

Core entities:
- User (student, teacher, recruiter)
- Profile (skills, GPA, achievements, endorsements)
- Project (repo link, description, outcomes)
- Team (members, roles, approvals)
- Opportunity (job, internship)
- MentorMatch (sessions, feedback)
- U-Score (reputation & performance metrics)
- Roadmap (career path, milestones, resources)

Illustrative ER (simplified)
```mermaid
erDiagram
  USER ||--o{ PROFILE : has
  USER ||--o{ TEAM_MEMBER : participates
  TEAM ||--o{ TEAM_MEMBER : includes
  USER ||--o{ PROJECT : owns
  PROJECT ||--o{ TASK : contains
  PROJECT ||--o{ FEEDBACK : receives
  USER ||--o{ FEEDBACK : gives
  USER ||--o{ OPPORTUNITY_APPLICATION : applies
  OPPORTUNITY ||--o{ OPPORTUNITY_APPLICATION : tracks
  USER ||--o{ CERTIFICATE : earns
  USER ||--o{ ROADMAP : follows
  ROADMAP ||--o{ MILESTONE : contains
```

U-Score considerations:
- Inputs: project outcomes, peer reviews, mentor feedback, code contributions, on-time delivery.
- Guardrails: explainability, bias checks, manual overrides for faculty.
